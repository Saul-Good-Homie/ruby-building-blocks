This is the final project from The Odin Project's Ruby Learning track. I created a 2 player command line chess game demonstrating the fundamentlas of Object Oriented Programming, Ruby Methods and data structures.

There are methods in place to prevent illegal moves and to alert of a check and mate.

Saving current games, and loading saved games is available at the start of the screen.

Methods not included but can be added at a later date: Castling, En Passant and Pawn Promotion.
